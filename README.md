# Attendance-Work-Flexibility-Insights-Dashboard
To improve workforce planning and identify attendance trends, I analyzed three months of employee presence, WFH, and sick leave data. The dashboard helps HR uncover hidden patterns, understand behavioral shifts, and support data-driven decision-making.

**Why This Analysis? (Problem Statement)**

HR teams often lack clear visibility into attendance trends.
This leads to:
❗ Unpredictable workforce availability
❗ Inefficient planning
